    "description": "I actively participated in the Bangkit Academy 2024 program, a collaborative initiative by Google, GoTo, and Traveloka, focusing on the Cloud Computing Learning Path. Through independent study activities, I deepened my knowledge of cloud computing through online classes on Dicoding Academy, Coursera, and Google Cloud Skills Boost. Throughout the program, I received guidance from mentors to overcome non-academic challenges and prepared for global certification exams. I also contributed to a final project with a team, where we applied our knowledge to a project with a theme of our choice approved by our mentor. The program provided opportunities to earn competency certificates each time we successfully passed exams for each taught skill. It was a valuable experience that enhanced my understanding in the field of cloud computing and provided a solid foundation for a career in the technology industry.",
